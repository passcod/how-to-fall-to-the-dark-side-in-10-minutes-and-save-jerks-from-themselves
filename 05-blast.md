{{Sylla}} woke up in despair and bewilderment, her last movement carried out
despite not being back there, in the fight, anymore, and she leaped off, got
tangled in her own duvet, and landed in a mess at the foot of her bed. Outside,
there was a loud clatter and rumble and the sound of Ben running towards her.

Well, towards the Temple, which she happened to be closest to.

_{{Mahl}} is a darksider?! Hels, {{Mahl}} is a darksider following the orders
of the same person {{Ben}} is? That... that changes everything._

While he hadn't said much, {{Mahl}} had revealed a lot during their brief
exchange.

Firstly, that there was a mastermind out there. The jumbled up fragments
{{Ben}} blurted and repeated outside before entering the Temple hinted at it,
but this was direct and incontroversible proof.

Secondly, that {{Mahl}} had been planted there, inside the {{org.newjedi}}, by
this mastermind. That person therefore knew where the Temple was, how to get
there, the identity of every being involved, and most likely their current
capabilities in all that was taught and practiced at the Temple. Furthermore,
they had a way of communicating that did not register as Dark or suspicious for
any of the highly sensitive Force users here, nor the less sensitive ones.

On that note, {{Mahl}} clearly was capable of cloaking his darkness. While some
had slipped through during the fight, likely because there would have been no
point restraining himself at that point, none had ever slipped during any of
the training or day to day events for the past several months. That was
alarming for several other reasons, but {{Sylla}} decided to focus on the
current set of revelations first.

The third thing {{Mahl}} had revealed was that {{Ben}} was "on a mission for
our Lord." While Master {{Skywalker}} may (he had been vague, and {{Sylla}}
wasn't sure what to think of all that anyway) have attacked Ben in the first
place, {{Ben}} had clearly violently responded, although it did look like
self-defense, especially as Master {{Skywalker}} wasn't dead. Unless that was
part of the mission. It was tough trying to reason about things with very
limited information.

But in any case, {{Ben}} was on a mission. A mission had parameters. One of
these was "acceptable losses". It was a tough part of strategy classes that
this parameter was very rarely _zero_. In {{Ben}}'s mission, zero didn't seem
to even be close. {{Sylla}} had either been an acceptable loss or part of the
mission.

She felt an absurd pleasure knowing that the loop reset if {{Ben}} exercised
this leeway in his mission parametres, or did anything towards the completion
of his goal in the latter case, ensuring he never got to finish his mission. He
might not know it, but he would fail. Every. Single. Time.

_Wait, where did that come from?_ she wondered. _"The loop resets every time
{{Ben}} kills?" Do I know that?_

She knew that if she died, the loop reset. If {{Ben}} died, ditto. If
{{Pritik}} died, it ended also. She suspected but did not know for sure that if
Master {{Skywalker}} died, the loop would reset.

But she didn't know about any of the others.

Perhaps she should find out.

That was one thing to explore. Another was {{Mahl}}'s darkness, abilities, and
mission. Especially, his ability to conceal his darkness at all times – or
almost. That was interesting for two reasons.

_No, three,_ she realised with creeping horror. _If one darksider is able to
inflitrate us and remain undetected, why not two? Or more?_

Alright, that was an unsettling thought. But one thing at a time. Reason one:
it meant darkness could be hidden. That was obviously a worry, even without
considering the possibility of more darksider inflitrators. She would have to
figure out if it was possible to defeat this, or at least detect the shielding
itself.

Reason two: if the dark could be hidden, so in turn could the light. Not just
strong shields, but truly disappearing into the Force: that was something
merely hinted at in the few old texts they could access, a feat of few Masters.
A skill lost. It would be a tremendous help to be able to do so, and beyond her
immediate situation, a great achievement.

And she had a practitioner of the skill right there.

_Of course, he's not going to just teach me._

Ah well. She wouldn't want him to, anyway. The very thought disturbed her;
likely because he'd just attempted — perhaps succeeded — to murder her and her
friends.

For some reason, that bothered her less than _{{Ben}}_ doing so. She knew
{{Ben}}. Distantly, but she did. And... he was a {{Solo}}. He was an
{{Organa}}. She had grown up hearing stories, of heroes, of adventures. Of
rescuers. {{Ryloth}} might not be part of the {{org.newrep}}, but it remembered
its liberators and defenders through the ages, and not all of them had names of
{{tw.lang}}. {{Sylla}}'s homeworld was not {{Ryloth}}, and still the stories
were told. Master {{Skywalker}} was a name that resonated strongly, even after
the {{org.empire}}, even after all this time, even beyond generations. Culture
was powerful, and culture bound all.

({{tw.people}} culture had always been a mix, especially outside {{Ryloth}}.
Before its invasion and subsequent appropriation at the hands of Imperials,
{{Ryloth}} {{tw.people}} culture had considered itself purer than offshoots,
and there remained some of that in the clans that survived. The elites. Purer,
perhaps, but poorer for it: where _{{tw.diaspora}}_, the {{tw.people}}
diaspora, had the legends of _{{tt.trickster}}_, the {{tt.adj}} trickster, and
the tales of hidden lovers with the {{md.adj}} _{{md.rainbow}}_, to guide their
acts and hearts in times of strife, the refugees of {{Ryloth}} only had
themselves. For many, too many, it was woefully unprepared they stepped into a
world where other beings, not _{{tw.ash}}_ storms nor _{{tw.volcano}}_
rumblers, were the most dangerous hostiles. Those that survived, learned. Those
that learned, survived.)

_Back on track. Let's figure this out. I can't actually just go out and take
out friends or classmates to see whether it would reset the loop._

For one thing, it was completely against her morals and ethics, even if dying
was impermanent at the moment. It would just be... wrong. For another, it would
show her the wrong thing: she wanted to know if or who {{Ben}} could dispatch
without resetting, not who _she_ could.

_Although, if I'm not able to deal with {{Mahl}}, it's going to complicate
things. Assuming I actually can take him on._

To make plans, then.

Predict: {{Ben}} killing anyone would reset the loop.

Experiment: She could just stand aside and watch, but... could she? Would she
be able to stay back and not defend a fellow student if they were attacked?

Well then. Predict: {{Ben}} killing another darksider would _not_ reset the
loop.

Experiment: Still a bit shady on the ethical side, but also {{Mahl}} fucking
deserved it after (before?) killing her friend. The issue was that {{Sylla}}
had no idea how to cause a confrontation and have {{Ben}} off {{Mahl}}. They
were allies, right?

Predict: {{Mahl}} and {{Ben}} aren't the only darksiders around.

Experiment: That's... straightforward enough. Just knock on every door,
determine if the person within is a darksider, next. Determine how?

Be bold: Just straight ask them. _It's not like they're going to be honest with
you, girl, what?_ But, well, why not? Obviously don't ask them if they're dark.
Tell them about {{Ben}}, but make it sound like _she_ was the one on a mission,
a mission that would derail theirs. Leave them to fill the gaps by themselves.
If necessary, mention this so-called Lord. Provoke them into attacking her.

Be prepared to run like hell: keep a lightsaber handy. Get a blaster from the
armoury. And if nothing else works, reset the loop.

How? {{Sylla}} got a terrifying idea, but dismissed it. _No. Not like that._
She'd figure it out.

"Let's do this thing," she spoke out loud.

She couldn't hear anything outside her door, and there was no close presence in
the Force. So {{Ben}} had moved on towards the centre of the Temple. That was
fine with her. She needed to get weaponry.

The armoury, the real one, not the training one, was next to the hangar. She
cast herself out a bit, feeling for immediate danger, but not risking alerting
anyone who might be awake and listening. Then she took her cloak, stepped out,
and jogged silently on the same route she took on the previous iteration.

Despite {{Mahl}}'s snarky comment, she knew how to be silent. She'd needed to,
once upon a time, and New Jedi training only improved those skills. Being
silent in the Force, though, that was another kettle of {{skorfin}}. Master
{{Skywalker}} used it to cheat, er, to improve his tactical advantage, and the
newly-discovered darksider obviously knew another technique. As it was,
{{Sylla}} only could quiet her mind, tighten her shields, and practice one of
the simplest ways to focus one's Force presence in a controlled manner:
consciously leaking it in one direction. In her case, down. It wasn't perfect,
by far, but it would put off casual scanning. At this juncture, it would have
to be enough.

The armoury was eerily silent, and much to her relief, undisturbed. It was bad
enough having murderous maniacs running around without them also being armed
with heavy rifles. Speaking of... Helloooo, StarAnvil. The rare blaster was
normally off-limits, due to being, well, irreplaceable. _I guess that's one
good thing out of this whole loop thing: can't damage it permanently!_

She lifted it reverently and checked it before slinging it. Then she picked a
couple of bog standard Westars, or more likely generic versions that worked
just as well for a fraction of the cost, and absent-mindedly slipped a hold-out
and a vibroknife in her boots. Apart from the heavy, a very typical kit.

_Time to hunt._

The first decision of the night was whether to go get {{Mahl}}, as a known
variable, or avoid him entirely and focus on others. {{Sylla}} reasoned that
while her stated goal was checking for other darksiders, a secondary goal was
seeing if offing them was safe, loop-wise. _Offing or capturing or putting out
of commission,_ she reminded herself. She wasn't a cold-blooded killer.

So she made her quiet way to the fourth tent and hit the doorbell, then calmed
her mind to feel, outwardly at least, like a friend. {{Mahl}} didn't
immediately answer, but she could sense his usual presence inside moving
around, presumably getting up. That was interesting: he was asleep, then, and
not watching through the Force or anything. That could be good news for stealth
in the future.

When the door opened, she didn't hesitate and fired four consecutive shots at
point blank range with the StarAnvil. The {{hu.people}} didn't really stand a
chance. He was hurled back through the habitat, catching on a table which sent
his body flying, hitting the back wall with a thud and a squelch. _I thought
you said you weren't a cold-blooded killer?_ a part of {{Sylla}} snidely
remarked. _Shut up, he started it,_ she replied.

"...Force, I'm speaking to myself," she voiced.

She waited a moment. That had not been quiet, even though the blaster itself
was of excellent make and had produced mostly light, not sound. Perhaps aiming
differently next time would reduce the amount of furniture that would get
impacted and thrown around. The darksider was dead and gone to the beyond, and
the loop had not reset! Well. Good. Onto other things.

She stepped aside, palmed the controls to close the door, and fried them so
they couldn't be activated again. One down. Five she could skip, including her
own. Nine huts to go. She hoped none of them housed another darksider.

She walked at sedate pace to the next one, as the few minutes it took were a
good time to calm herself down — despite having done relatively little, her
adrenaline had spiked — and let the cannon cool down. The next hut housed
{{Vsan}} {{Toor}}, and they had extra senses. During tactics practice,
{{Sylla}} had observed reactions that only really made sense if the
{{kd.people}} could feel heat at a distance, even through duracrete, although
she had never confirmed it. Better to take the precaution.

They weren't friends, but {{Toor}} liked her. None of the students here (with
the exception of {{Ben}}, she would have thought, before) were unfamiliar with
strife. In the red-skinned {{kd.adj}}, that manifested as ruthlessness paired
with quick reflexes, that made them a very good ally to have in unfamiliar
terrain, or a terror to have as an enemy. She _really hoped_ they weren't a
darksider. Fighting them would be a nightmare.

She hit the buzzer. Knocking would do nothing: the {{kd.people}} had an
interior controlled atmosphere behind an airlock beyond a small reception
space, and sound would not carry through. Inside, {{Toor}} could live and sleep
without their mask, which they otherwise never removed, but of course no-one
else could share nor even enter their quarters — although some species might be
able to with a rebreather, provided their skin would not corrode in the
presence of the {{kd.gas}} gas.

(Master {{Skywalker}} had simply stepped in unbothered and unharmed, because
the laws of physics apparently did not apply to Master {{Skywalker}}. She'd
asked, {{Toor}} had asked, most everyone had asked, but he'd only smiled and
said something overly cryptic.)

"You're up early, {{Rill}}. Anything I may do for you?" {{Vsan}} {{Toor}}
inquired, voice gruff and leaning against the doorjamb.

"{{Toor}}. There's a darksider in the temple. Want to join me in hunting it
down?"

The {{tw.people}} indicated vaguely to the side with a casual head tilt and a
lilt of her lekku.

{{Toor}}'s skin folds did something complicated that she understood as being
consideration or skepticism or slight surprise. She would have held her breath
if that hadn't had the possibility of giving away the game.

"Let me guess: {{Skywalker}} trial?"

_Probably not dark, then._ she thought with relief.

Outwardly, she quirked her lips. The {{kd.people}} took that as confirmation.

"I'll pass, then."

_Most probably not dark, or at least not {{Ben}}-allied._

They took a step back into their hut, but couldn't resist to give some advice:
"Just don't fail and you'll be fine."

{{Sylla}} smirked, and answered truthfully: "Couldn't if I tried."

"Alright. No need to be overconfident, though," they chided as they closed the
door, waving her off. "Trials are no joke."

_Don't I know it,_ she thought wryly, turning away. _Don't I know it._

These trials were not the capital-T Trials of old, a kind of graduation exam,
although the texts spoke of a spiritual journey and the holorecords showed
perilous solo missions by _children_. No, these lowercase-t trials were simply
solo training exercises given by teachers to one particular student, sometimes
months in advance. It wasn't against the rules to ask for help, but it was rare
for people to actually join in unless it helped them with their own, too. There
was a small market of favours that had established itself around the practice.
It simulated some of the dynamics out in the Outer Rim and amongst traders,
bounty hunters, smugglers, mercenaries, politicians, and the rest of the
semi-underground community out there in the galaxy... but at a smaller and
safer scale.

Trials given by Master {{Skywalker}} had a well-earned reputation for being
either hard, ridiculously hard, or just plain ridiculous. They always included
various kinds of work, from research to pursuit to investigation to full-on
skirmishes. {{LSTekka}}'s were about applying cultural knowledge for gain, and
the toughest stealth work she'd ever done. And so on.

Slowly weaving a zigzag through the encampment, {{Sylla}} showed up at every
hut she knew was inhabited on her way to the last row, which contained only
hers, {{Ben}}'s, Master {{Skywalker}}'s at a distance, and two others including
an empty one. They happened in much the same fashion, with similar results.

{{Kelpura}} tried to dive into the Force to sense something that could help
her, but it _was_ very early in the morning and the {{anx.people}} had not
extensively trained in her chosen specialty yet. She had come out disoriented,
and only commented that “Master {{Skywalker}} is really going all out for you:
I cannot tell if the dark presence is genuine or not.”

{{Nuquierissan}} had made her wince with his volume, but that was habitual for
the {{hu.people}}. She was glad it took less than three exchanges for her to
confirm what she wanted and for him to go back to sleep. {{Sylla}} swore she
could hear him snore just moments after she'd cleared his hut, even through the
steel.

The {{bo.hybrid}} {{Tallya}} had hastily combed his mane before opening the
door, and although he was taken aback at the hairless {{tw.people}} before him,
had still attempted to entice her inside. She had left flustered, amused, and
flattered, in a way, but not in any she'd really care for.

_When I get out of this I'll have to make clear I don't_ do _that,_ she mused.

It was on the seventh hut that events caught up to {{Sylla}}. No-one answered.
The door was closed although not locked, and at a closer a few slightly wet
prints could be seen on the hearth, like someone had stepped in then out — the
'leaving' print overlapped and smudged the 'entering' one, so she was pretty
sure it was in this order — not too long ago. At some point during the night.
But she hadn't seen nor felt anyone in this area this iteration or any time
during the previous ones when she was paying attention.

Insisting with the door, she finally decided to open the door herself. Worst
case scenario, she'd step in on a naked {{Refe}} and it would all be terribly
embarassing, but nobody would know once she woke up again. She could live with
that.

_You need to revisit your worst case scenarios,_ her brain hissed as she took
in the scene before her.

There was blood on the floor, burns on the walls, and {{Refe}} on the ground.
Unconscious, thankfully, not dead.

She rushed at {{Refe}}'s side, looking at her and patting and feeling but she
couldn't find an injury. The blood was hers, though. {{el.people}} bled red
like most {{hu.adjoid}}s, but they also had an extreme coagulant in their blood
that was activated by air. To {{Sylla}}'s knowledge, no one else here had that
characteristic. So unless there was a _second_ {{el.people}} who had bled in
{{Refe}}'s hut before getting away...

She needed to get {{Refe}} to the med-bay, but something was deeply off here.
For one, as far as she could tell, the {{el.people}} was unharmed, only
unconscious. She could not find where she had bled from. Unless she had coughed
up the liquid, which seemed unlikely given the species' physiology, the only
logical explanation was that someone had injured her, then healed her, but then
also left her there.

_I wonder if she has door surveillance. She's from a pretty well-off family, I
think..._

The hut's interior was richly decorated. Well, for one thing, it was decorated.
Her own chambers were bare and functional, with only keepsakes and sentimental
objects. From what she'd seen of others', {{Refe}}'s rooms were practically
regal. Lush fabrics hung as curtains, flat holos adorned the walls, and there
was actual furniture.

So it wasn't a surprise to find the door had a state-of-the-art monitoring and
auditing facility, complete with its own interface. _Overkill,_ she thought.
_Although I suppose it turned out to be useful._

She found the log for herself entering just a few minutes prior. The only
entries before that were {{Ben}}. Entering at about two hours past sundown,
then leaving a quarter hour later. No-one else, going backwards through the
log, until {{Refe}}'s return from lessons at the expected time. _What were you
doing there, {{Ben}}?_

{{Sylla}} tried to recall what she knew of the time before this loop, this
phenomenon, started. It was hazy in her mind. There had been a party, out in
the open. Was {{Ben}} there? He must have been. He was always there. But she
couldn't remember when and where. She hadn't been drinking, though, or anything
that might explain the uncertainty. A lot had happened in between, that was
why. Even though physically it had only been a few hours, in spirit and in mind
it had been days, emotional, wrenching, desperate days.

_I can't wait too much longer. I have to get her to medical._

Even though there was nobody there but a droid, even though she knew it would
not matter once the loop reset, even though she knew {{Refe}} had very little
chance to wake up and tell her about what had happened before the next restart.
Even though 'medical' was in the temple, and that was where {{Ben}} was, too.

{{Sylla}} briefly considered hauling {{Refe}} on her shoulders before resorting
to the Force to float her classmate along. Not only would that be faster and
probably less tiring, although prolonged use of the Force took its toll just
like anything else, but it would also be more healthy for {{Refe}}: the less
movement and pulling and pushing in odd ways, the better. Almost like a
stretcher, only... without the stretcher.

_Just don't drop her,_ her inner voice piped up. _So you might want to not run
into darksiders, inquisitive colleagues, murderous bastards... Easy peasy,
right?_

And surprisingly, it was.

Despite her misgivings, {{Sylla}} encountered no-one between {{Refe}}'s hut and
the Temple. Not even a thunderous Master {{Skywalker}}, who was still under his
pile of rocks, unless he'd managed to get out from it all without disturbing
the whole mess. She felt guilty about leaving him there, but he was safer
there, or at least the iteration was safer without his intervention. She needed
information, and she wouldn't get it if he went saber blazing into the fray.

The med-bay was technically called the Healing Halls, after the old Temples,
but it was really just a capital ship's med-bay that had been dismantled and
re-assembled inside a set of rooms. Occasionally someone opened something, a
cupboard, a storebox, anything... and {{Jakku}}'s sand poured out, getting
everywhere.

{{Sylla}} floated the unconscious {{el.people}} to the nearest bed, then went
to close the door before waking up M5-D5, their med droid. Predictably, the
droid's voice module activated loudly before she instructed it to quiet down
and pointed out the possibly injured and most certainly completely out of it
patient just lying there.

"What have you young ladies done again?" and the {{tw.people}} winced at the
disapproval in the droid's mannerisms.

"Nothing! Nothing. I just— found her like that?" she defended herself.

Deefive rotated its head towards her doubtfully before blithely getting back to
its scan and fussing and mumbling in binary. {{Sylla}} considered herself lucky
to have escaped its attention, and tiptoed out of the room. Now that she was
here in the Temple, she may as well go see what {{Ben}} was doing.

Out in the main hall, she could hear echoes of voices, perhaps even shouts or
at the very least, an argument breaking out. {{Ben}} wasn't alone, then? Apart
from {{Skywalker}}, probably still under debris, the only remaining people
unaccounted for were the two who lived after {{Refe}}, who she hadn't visited
yet.

She kept her footfalls quiet, but hurried in the direction of the noise. She
recognised the voices now: they did indeed belong to her three classmates:
{{Ben}} and {{Devasha}} and {{Treyude}}, but she couldn't tell any word out
from the mixed up echoes. They came from the sparring room. She stopped when
the entrance became visible, pricking up her {{tw.ear.f}}s in an attempt to
listen in without exposing herself. She could distinguish a few words: dark,
master, boy. It wasn't enough, so she approached the doorway, sticking to the
wall as much as possible.

Quickly peeking around the reveal, she saw that none were directly facing the
entrance (_Sloppy. What would {{LSTekka}} say?_) and positioned herself to
observe better. The body language of {{Treyude}} was outwardly aggressive but
she recognised {{Ben}}'s coiled nervosity. {{Devasha}} was slightly off to the
side, and while she was clearly interested by the discussion, appeared calmer,
or more detached.

{{Sylla}} had been watching for a few minutes, trying to decide whether to make
herself known, or to go back to {{Refe}}, when {{Treyude}} stepped back half a
step, threw his head back and made a disparaging wave of his hand. {{Ben}}
snapped something and made towards his lightsaber: that pushed the other two to
jump out, weapons blazing.

"Oy!" {{Sylla}} called, waving a blaster. She needed to stop this before it
went too far.

Unfortunately, she mistimed her shout, and to her dismay the only person she
already knew could not die without resetting the loop failed to duck.

---

She woke up frustrated and angry at herself, at {{Ben}}, at {{Devasha}} and
{{Treyude}}. Outside her door a boy tripped in the dark, and she didn't care.
Sighing, she sat up, pondering what she should do this time.
