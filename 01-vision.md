Sylla Rill was woken up by a cry and roar she wasn't sure wasn't part of a dream,
followed by loud clatter and the sound of someone tripping outside on the
Temple's steps.

_It's too early even for Master Skywalker_, she growled while grabbing around
for a robe and standing up groggily.

"Oi" she yelled, opening her door. "What's with the..."

The words died in her throat at the sight of Ben Solo, panting and clutching
his lightsabre hilt, shirt torn and eternal black trousers dusty. He looked
bewildered and in shock. She rushed to him.

"What happened? Are you alright?"

He looked up, eyes not quite reaching hers, and haltingly, voice low but
picking up volume: "Master— Uncle— he. He tried to kill me. He tried to kill
me!"

_What._

She repeated the word, adding "Are you sure? That doesn't— Skywalker?"

Ben jerked away from her, his voice wobbling as he continued: "You don't
believe me. You don't!" he yelled when she tried opening her mouth, "he told
me... He told me they'd not believe..."

_Who...?_ she wondered, inching forward again. Ben wasn't making sense, but she
had to calm him down. Everyone had times when they woke up in a panic still
believing they were in their old life, or not recognising friends. She tried to
send some soothing through the Force.

Ben, who had turned around, still talking to himself, flinched, rounded up on
her, visage distorted by rage. "You're trying to manipulate me! He told me!
Stop trying to Force your Light on me!"

He stepped closer, and she stepped back involuntarily. "You don't believe me,
do you?"

"Ben," she tried, "you have to—"

"You're either with me or against me," he snarled, stepping forward.

"What are you—" but the Force was screaming "—talking about" she tried to
finish. Pain and harsh light in her stomach, in her chest. Then nothing more.
