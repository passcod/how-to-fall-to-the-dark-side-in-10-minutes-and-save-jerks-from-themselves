The next few wakings were very similar. Sylla decided to try doing the same
thing over and over until she got it right. It was a good plan, she was sure of
it. She just needed to tweak a few things. Get the timing right.

She got her wake up routine down to an art.

Wake up, permalock her door, change into battle clothes, perform moving
meditation until the dark presence had moved away and her shields were
durasteel, cut herself out.

The plan after that was usually to run all the way to the shuttle, pick up
Master Skywalker, pick up some of her classmates, warn the others, fly off.

One time she forgot to catch the section of door she cut off with the Force.
The piece of durasteel, warped by the heat, clanged loudly on the marble,
bouncing and rolling and making a right tintamarre. The bastard came running
back, she threw her lightsabre at his face, and woke up feeling quite
satisfied.

Adjusting her cutting angle so that the door section would slide inward added
two dozen seconds to the cutting time, but was worth it. Sylla was now able to
catch the durasteel with her hands. A further modification saw the metal panel
slide in and fall with a soft _whump_ on her bed sheets bundled near the door.
A few replays later, the sheets were soaked in water to avoid getting ignited
by the sparks and causing a fire.

(The consequences of the fire were never pleasant, although she had so far
avoided burning to waking up. That was something she wasn't looking forward to
ever happening.)
