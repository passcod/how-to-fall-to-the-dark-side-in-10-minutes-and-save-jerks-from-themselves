She woke up frustrated and angry at herself, at {{Ben}}, at {{Devasha}} and
{{Treyude}}. Outside her door a boy tripped in the dark, and she didn't care.
Sighing, she sat up, pondering what she should do this time.

Well, she'd observed several interesting things: two fellow students talking
with {{Ben}}, without him turning violent _immediately_ as he'd done with her.
Furthermore, from the previous time when she'd done her katas as moving
meditation, she'd stayed in her hut for quite a while, and while she hadn't
been focused outward, she was pretty sure nobody else had stepped by. The
building had other entrances, but it felt like a good guess that both
{{Devasha}} and {{Treyude}} were waiting for {{Ben}}, in some sort of midnight
meeting.

Which was odd, right? It didn't really match the other facts, that {{Ben}} had
come rushing to the Temple after being attacked out of nowhere by his uncle,
likely because the boy was Falling, or a traitor, or both. How did a
pre-arranged clandestine meeting fit? For that matter, how did that fit with
his being in another student's quarters' security records just hours prior?

So that was one thing to investigate. Yet {{Refe}} felt more pressing. Probably
because {{Sylla}} knew her classmate was injured _right now_. And the
{{el.people}} had to have seen something, and clearly wasn't allied with
whoever had attacked her. If she got her to Deefive right away, there might be
a chance to wake her up before anything happened to reset the world again, and
she could gain precious information that happened _before_ the reset point.

About that. There had been a party, the night before. Here, rested, while she
was still upset and, if she was being honest with herself, still shocked, or in
shock, at everything... she could recall a bit more of it. She should meditate
on it, a Force meditation focused on the memories, to fix them in her mind.

It took her less than a minute to sink halfway into the Force. If it's an
ocean, she's up to her midsection, not enough to float in, but enough for it to
be hard to move around. She approached the pillar she used to represent her
memory, huge, round, covered in scratches and markers and drawings. She spared
a thought for the real one, still out there on {{Coruscant}}, and wondered if
she'd ever see it again.

The party... {{Sylla}} hadn't recalled any special occasion, so there must not
have been one. Perhaps someone had thrown something together after a
particularly grueling trial. It would have been the middle of the tenday if
they were following any kind of regular calendar, but with so few of them and
so many different cultures, especially as they were all adults or thereabout,
everyone just kinda did their own thing, and self-directed for study. No
particular schedule, apart from planned lectures, and all but one of the
Masters were away at that moment. Master {{Skywalker}} didn't do _planning_.

She'd come back to her rooms to set down her pads after a study session, and
that had been after being told by... {{Nuquierissan}}. Along with everyone else
in the vicinity. It hadn't been told to her personally, just ~~shouted~~ spoken
at, well, {{Nuquierissan}} volumes in the room.

Someone had set an open fire. The night hadn't been cold, not for her, but heat
perception varied. She guessed it was more because it was the done thing, an
open fire to rally around, or to sit next to. It kept insects away, in any
case.

It had been less of a party, now that she thought about it, and more of an
extended hang out. People came and went. Master {{Skywalker}} had peeked in at
some point. {{Drace}} had talked about a project a bit, seeking feedback.
{{Pritik}} had flittered about. {{Mahl}} was there, but somewhere else most of
the time. _Where?_ Not anywhere her mind could recall. Peering carefully at her
memories, she caught a glimpse of the human darksider leaving in the general
direction of his hut. Alone. Ambling, not in a hurry.

Around the end of the night, she'd gotten into a conversation with {{Devasha}}
about false-similarity of flora between planets, after idly wondering if a
particular grassy plant around the camp would be edible, given its high
resemblance to yellow corleaf on {{Rodia}}. She noted that even in meditation,
she still felt frustration towards {{Devasha}}, and bled that into the Force.

When she came out of trance, {{Sylla}} felt more refreshed than in days, and
sure she wouldn't forget any potentially important details she didn't yet know
to look for in her memories of the night.

The {{tw.people}} stood slowly, and stretched while she re-established herself
in her surroundings.

There was no presence outside her door, and only if she strained could she feel
distant presences at the other side of the Temple building. Good.

---

It was a simple plan: get out, go get weaponry, incapacitate {{Mahl}}, get
{{Refe}} to medical, don't make any other moves or changes until {{Refe}} wakes
and can give some more details.

The trip to the armoury was as uneventful as it had been before. She still
tamped her presence down as much as she could, if nothing else to try to keep
things as they were. At the armoury, she dithered a bit, but settled on not
taking a shuttle: it didn't improve her security all that much, last time, and
using a combat ship to shoot up {{Mahl}} from atmo would probably be way
overkill and would destroy the element of stealth she was going for. As
satisfying as it would be.

So she'd picked the exact same kit she'd gotten before, made a beeline for
{{Mahl}}'s door, shot him point blank, as before, regretted it for all of five
seconds â€” maybe it would have been better to ask a few questions, ah well,
there's always another time. So far, so (violently) good. Time to take care of
an injured {{el.people}}.

{{Refe}}'s hut was silent, and after she cut through the door, she found its
occupant in the same state as before: thick, coagulated blood on the floor,
burns in long ellipsical shapes on walls, furniture thrown over, broken
objects...

_Broken_ objects?

At first glance, this had looked like a lightsabre attack. But now that she
wasn't hurried, {{Sylla}} could see it was only _made_ to look like that. The
burns were of the wrong shape, though she couldn't imagine what would have made
them. Fragile objects were shattered, but one wooden bowl she could see had
been cut cleanly through, as if a sabre passed through, yet with none of the
characteristic burning at the edges. And despite the unconscious victim's
complete lack of visible injuries, she would have had to be stabbed or sliced
without cauterisation to bleed this much.

{{Mahl}} had a sith-red lightsabre when he attacked her. Why wouldn't he have
used it? For that matter, _everyone_ here had one, too. Did this indicate the
presence of a third darksider, someone from outside, who wasn't a jedi or
didn't have a sabre?

{{Sylla}} tried to cast her mind back to Master {{Matako}}'s workshop on
vibroblades, to recall whether they did that sort of damage, but came up empty.
She made a note to, at some point later, fetch one from the armoury and compare
the cuts.
